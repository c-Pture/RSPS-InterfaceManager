## ![STAR](https://cpture.xyz/assets/github/misc/repos/img/star.png) About the InterfaceManager

The InterfaceManager is a simple implementation to help you manage interface handling in RuneScape Private Servers.

The main goal is to make it easier to manage and track the interfaces of the users but also to prevent cheating using a modified client.
If the client-side openes an interface and the user wants to use it (Request button presses etc.), the server can then simply double check the information
by checking with the interface manager if the interface is indeed open or not.
