# InterfaceManager
Interface Management system for RuneScape Private Servers

![Development_status](https://cpture.xyz/assets/github/misc/repos/img/started.png)

The Interface Manager is a simple tool to manage opening and closing interfaces for RsPs
Keep track of the current interface which is open and add requirements in order to open an interface

The main goal is to make it easier to manage and track the interfaces of the users but also to prevent cheating using a modified client.
If the client-side openes an interface and the user wants to use it (Request button presses etc.), the server can then simply double check the information
by checking with the interface manager if the interface is indeed open or not.

More information will follow shortly.
